Simple recipe website

Dec 15, 2022. Creating a web application using HTML, CSS, JavaScript
and possibly storing the information in a database. The website is
about storing and displaying recipes, but with a bit of twist! 

Some additional features:
 - recipe managing 
 - interactive cooking
 - guide, and also community/friends sharing.
