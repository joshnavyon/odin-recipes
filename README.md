# odin-recipes

Simple website containing all my personal recipes

Dec 15, 2022. My first Odin Project. Creating a web application
using HTML, CSS, JavaScript and possibly storing the information
in a Database. This website is used to store recipes, and display
it elegantly, along with some additional features such as recipe
managing, interactive cooking guide, and also community/friends sharing.
